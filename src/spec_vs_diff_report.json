  "summary": "REQ-7 and REQ-8 are largely implemented: screen changes are wrapped in a ScreenTransition component with slide-in animations and FirstScreen includes floating decorative “Yes/No” elements with pointer-events disabled. However, the diff only shows slide-in (enter) animations and does not clearly implement an outgoing (exit) slide, so the “between outgoing and incoming” aspect of the slide transition cannot be confirmed from the diff summary alone. Some additional global styling/theme/font changes appear beyond the explicit request.",

      "id": "REQ-7",
      "requirement": "Animated slide transitions between screens should occur between outgoing and incoming screen content (not only a fade), smoothly, without layout jumping, centered within ValentineLayout.",
      "reason": "The diff shows only enter (slide-in) animations applied to the new screen via key-based remounting; there is no evidence of an exit animation for the outgoing screen or any mechanism (e.g., stacked elements / presence management) to animate both outgoing and incoming simultaneously, so the ‘between outgoing and incoming’ behavior and ‘no layout jumping’ cannot be fully verified from the provided changes.",
