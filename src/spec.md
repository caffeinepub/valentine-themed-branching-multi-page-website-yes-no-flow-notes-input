# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add slide-style screen transitions and subtle floating “Yes/No” decorative animations to the existing Valentine single-page flow without changing content or behavior.

**Planned changes:**
- Implement smooth slide transitions when switching between existing screens (First -> No, First -> Yes Step 1 -> Yes Step 2 -> Yes Final) using in-app state (no URL routing).
- Add gentle floating/drifting decorative “Yes” and “No” elements on the first screen that match the current Valentine styling and do not interfere with button clicks/taps.

**User-visible outcome:** Navigating through the Valentine flow shows a visible slide transition between screens, and the first screen includes subtle floating “Yes/No” decorations while all existing buttons and behaviors work as before.
